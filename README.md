## GCP WSI converter

This GCP converter writes WSI DICOM images:

https://github.com/jcupitt/wsi-to-dicom-converter

I compiled and ran it like this:

```
$ wsi2dcm \
  --input CMU-1-small-region.svs \
  --outFolder cmu-1-small-region \
  --batch 1000000 \
  --seriesDescription x \
  --levels 20
```
